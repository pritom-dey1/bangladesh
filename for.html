  <header><h1 class="rt">Foreign-relations OF BANGLADESH</h1></header>
  <DIV class="for">The foreign relations of Bangladesh are Bangladesh's relationships with foreign countries. The Government of Bangladesh's policies pursue a moderate foreign policy that heavily relies on multilateral diplomacy, especially at the United Nations (UN) and the World Trade Organization (WTO). Since its independence in 1971, Bangladesh has stressed its principle of "Friendship towards all, malice towards none" in dictating its diplomacy. As a member of the Non-Aligned Movement, Bangladesh has tended to not take sides with major powers. Since the end of the Cold War, Bangladesh has pursued better relations with its neighbours and other nearby states.

    The Bangladeshi government has begun to implement a foreign policy that pursues regional economic integration in South Asia and aims to establish Bangladesh as a regional hub of transit trade in Asia.
    
    Policy
    The foreign policy of Bangladesh consists of various strategies chosen by the Constitution and government of the country to safeguard its national interests and to achieve goals from its place on the world stage. The Bangladeshi Ministry of Foreign Affairs formulates and executes the policies according to the guidance from the relevant section of the Constitution of Bangladesh.[1]
    
    The fundamental foreign policies of Bangladesh originate from Article 25 of the Constitution of Bangladesh:[2]
    
    "The State shall base its international relations on the principles of respect for national sovereignty and equality, non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries, peaceful settlements of international disputes, and respect for international law and the principles enunciated in the United Nations Charter, and on the basis of those principles shall-
    
    Strive for the renunciation of the use of force in international relations and for general and complete disarmament;
    Uphold the right of every people freely to determine and build up its own social, economic and political system by ways and means of its own free choice; and
    Support oppressed peoples throughout the world waging a just struggle against imperialism, colonialism or racialism."</DIV>
